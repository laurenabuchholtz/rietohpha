I have noticed a steady decrease in my computer's processing power as if my RAMs had died. Yet they seem working. I thought I could probably fix it so I cleaned my computer, cleared up disk space, spyware scanned, deleted browsing history and defragmented. Surprisingly enough nothing ever changed.

I've been using VLC Media Player for a small while, but I've recently heard of a player called MPC-HC. When I went to look into it, I found others suggesting even more video players I had never heard of. Potplayer is one, for example. What would you guys suggest? P.S. This is a crosspost from r/Software. I thought asking on two subs would garner a better chance of getting a good response. ____ Update: After having downloaded, installed, and uninstalled several media players, I've made the choic. #A Werewolf in Time Saves Nine Life is Strange has a secret story hiding under the surface. It‚Äôs the story of Francis Bowers, the true main character of Life is Strange. Like a hairy werewolf wearing a chic, sugar-coated sheepskin, it‚Äôs very well camouflaged. but if you look closely enough, you can see little tufts of fur poking out from between the seams. It‚Äôs not a straightforward story. It‚Äôs more like a half-remembered song, buried beneath the fragments of a thousand other stories lodge. #Layer upon lair Layering is the key to unlocking the secrets of Life is Strange. To find his treasure Chris places an overlay on top of his map. To dig up Bluebeard‚Äôs loot, Chloe attaches a special lens to her telescope. To locate the Dark Room, Max pins all the clues together on top of the childhood mural. To create Mantroid, Chris adds Mantle St. to Asteroid Dr. According to Raoul Barbet and Michel Koch, the directors of LiS, Rachel is a merger of their first names. Chloe‚Äôs home addres. 
Hello friends, I always found lots of great answers on this subreddit and since I stumbled on a discovery today that made my life a lot easier, I thought I might share it with you.

if you read my past comments i had a rough start with Go, but what was after the first welcome screen was so much better, i really could not expect it. I owned several cardboard hmd, used DK1, DK2, got CV1, i mostly passed my VR years studying and waiting anxiously (what a pain) for a consumer ready device. I'm not really a gamer, my first approach with CV1 was amazing but since my need was a desktop replacement or enjoying media, it totally failed on me to deliver. Godrays were killer When I start my Dell Dimension 9150 from 2004 but with a graphics card from 2014, connected to my Samsung Plasma TV PS42Q92, from 2007 and purchased 2008, and coming into the desktop for the computer, there is a field down right, just above the list, which is lighter than the rest of the screen (which is a whole black background). The field is approximately 10-15 cm x 10-15 cm and is a row of icons above the list and up, as well as going down to the trash bin (see Figure 1). The light phenomeno.

I've completely optimized the video in Media Player Classic - Home Cinema, and now i want to start on the audio. I know i should probably get an external sound card of some sort, but right now i don't. By the way I know little to nothing about this stuff, so my apologies. I'm just using my Sennheiser HD558s through the headphone jack on my laptop. I have Dolby Atmos for headphones spatial sound with 7.1 virtualization.

I have performed very recently a clean install of the Fall Creators Update for Windows 10 x64 (build 1709, installed through an official ISO).
