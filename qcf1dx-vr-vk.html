Once a day (or as often as you can) visit the New section of /r/startups. Downvote all the bullshit blog spam. Upvote EVERYTHING relevant. Pretty much all self-posts, and the blogs that are useful should be up other whenever you see them! Seriously, I can't overstate how much you actually need to upvote everything non-shitty  Once a core group of redditors are doing this, the rest will take care of itself. Bonus points if you can do the same in a few 'Hot' posts' comments. This is not my steam account. My friend bought a New PC and ever since he gets this messege ( whenever he tries to open it.

CAD heavily excels with mechanical designs, where the object is defined by measurements, angles, tolerances, quicker to revision 3D modeling when you think of those interesting artistic buildings or those pieces of terrain for on a game table, 3D modeling was behind the scenes, not as heavily defined process as CAD 3D sculpting, think of having a virtual ball of clay, your pinching it, smoothing it, pulling

Inspired by that last post and also my own recommendations as a pretty big musichead, this is going to be a fucking huge reclist of stuff even vaguely like Glass Animals or that I think people who are into Glass Animals would also like! I'll do a section of my own recs and a section of stuff culled from the list in the other thread. Note that I’m leaning towards more obscure acts! Most descriptions are from allmusic.com, one of my favorite websites, but I wrote or edited Kaminari is a character that I like, but at the same time, I've grown to be increasingly annoyed by. Kaminari has one of the most powerful types of abilities in Shounen, and abilities that are tough in comics, but at a much lesser degree: electricity manipulation. For comics, the top ones that comes to my head are: Black Lightning from DC Static from DC Electro from Marvel And in Shounen: Sasuke, Kakashi, Killer B, and the Raikages from Naruto Misaki from ToAru Zatch The Great Faker: Robert Mueller Every single one of Robert Mueller’s important investigations has ended in failure and disaster. Robert Mueller specializes in thwarting justice while giving the appearance of legitimacy. https://pic8.co/sh/9WZCOD.png With a large swathe of the country finally realizing what millions of Americans have already known for years, Robert Mueller has “botched” yet another important investigation.

Hi, Attached below my save. In this save, I earn 4e438 larvae per second, and I have 3e1568 swarmlings creating territory. All these swarmlings are from HOM. Swarmlings from meat are 1000 orders of a magnitude less. So the game for me is: every now and then do a few swarmswamps to grow some more meat units, but then do everything on HOM because the swarmlings growth is the only real growth here. Is that then the end of the game? Is there anything that can change the situation into different. I am trying to make a PDF for sending it as an attachment via mail. But FPDF says `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'i'` when I perform the operation at `line 15`. Can someone help me with this?

Continuing from this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/vulkan/comments/bj19as/how\_to\_submit\_multiple\_layers\_of\_vkimage\_to\_openvr/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/vulkan/comments/bj19as/how_to_submit_multiple_layers_of_vkimage_to_openvr/) I have a working multiview stereo (submitting to OpenVR) renderer. I followed and adapted Sascha Willems' multiview sample at https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan/blob/master/examples/multiview/multiview.cpp (https://github.com/SaschaWille. I'm currently trying to implement a multiview (using VK\_KHR\_multiview) VR renderer. The rendering itself works, no problem there. But to get the image to OpenVR (or rather, SteamVR), I need to submit each eye's texture to the VRCompositor. The left/right eye textures are stored in one VkImage that is set up to have 2 arrayLayers. Accessing layer 0 seems simple, that's just the regular VkImage handle. But how do I pass layer 1 to OpenVR? It expects a uint64\_t handle to a VkImage. &#x20.
